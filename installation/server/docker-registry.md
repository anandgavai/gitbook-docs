# Docker registry

A registry (repository) provides storage and versioning for Docker images. Installing a (private) Docker registry can be useful if you want to securely host your own algorithms.&#x20;

### Docker registry

Docker provides a registry as a turn-key solution on Docker Hub. Instructions for setting it up can be found here: [https://hub.docker.com/\_/registry](https://hub.docker.com/\_/registry).&#x20;

### Harbor

[Harbor ](https://goharbor.io)is another option for running a registry. Harbor provides access control, a user interface and automated scanning on vulnerabilities.
