# 🐍 Python

## Python 3.7.x

Installation of any of the **vantage6** packages requires Python 3.7. For installation instructions, see [python.org](https://python.org), [anaconda.com](https://anaconda.com) or use the package manager native to your OS and/or distribution (e.g. `apt` for debian or Ubuntu, `yum` for fedora, or `yast` for SuSE).

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend you install **vantage6** in a new, clean environment.&#x20;

Other version of Python >= 3.6 will most likely also work, but may give issues with installing dependencies. For now, we test vantage6 on version 3.7, so that is a safe choice...
{% endhint %}
