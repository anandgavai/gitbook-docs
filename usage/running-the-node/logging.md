# Logging

Logging is enabled by default. To configure the logger look at [#configuration-file-structure](../running-the-server/server-configuration.md#configuration-file-structure "mention") in the `logging` section.&#x20;

Useful commands:

1. `vnode files`: shows you where the log file is stored
2. `vnode attach`: shows live logs of a running server in your current console. This can also be achieved when starting the node with `vnode start --attach`
