description: In this section we'll explain how to deploy a vantage6 server.

# Deployment

vantage6 uses Flask as backbone, together with flask-socketio for websocket support. The server runs as a standalone process (listening on its own ip address/port).

{% hint style="info" %}
From version 3.2+ it is possible to horizontally scale the server (This upgrade is also made available to version 2.3.4)

Documentation on how to deploy it will be shared here. Reach out to us on Discord for now.

~~Because there is no message broker used for the websocket channel, it is currently not possible to horizontally scale the vantage6-server~~
{% endhint %}

There are many deployment options, so these examples are not complete and exhaustive.

* [NGINX](deployment.md#nginx)
* [Azure app service](deployment.md#undefined)
* ...

## NGINX

Below a basic setup. Note that SSL is not configured in this example.

```nginx
server {
    
    # Public port 
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    # vantage6-server. In the case you use a sub-path here, make sure
    # to foward also it to the proxy_pass
    location /subpath {
        include proxy_params;
        
        # internal ip and port 
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/subpath;
    }
    
    # Allow the websocket traffic
    location /socket.io {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/socket.io;
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When you [server-configuration.md](server-configuration.md "mention") the server, make sure to include the `/subpath` that has been set in the NGINX configuration into the `api_path` setting (e.g. `api_path: /subpath/api`)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Azure app service&#x20;
