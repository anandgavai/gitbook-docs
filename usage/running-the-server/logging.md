# Logging

Logging is enabled by default. To configure the logger look at [#configuration-file-structure](server-configuration.md#configuration-file-structure "mention") in the `logging` section.&#x20;

Useful commands:

1. `vserver files`: shows you where the log file is stored
2. `vserver attach`: show live logs of a running server in your current console. This can also be achieved when starting the server with `vserver start --attach`
